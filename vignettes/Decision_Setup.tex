The central concept is that pairs of ostensibly related features from two different platforms should fall into three categories: 
\itemize{
\item{\textbf{“+”}:	both features are correctly identified and mapped between platforms, and truly biologically coupled (for example, correlated) as expected,} 

\item{\textbf{“0”}:	both features are correctly identified and mapped, but biologically decoupled in the sample group under study, due to causes unaccounted-for up to now, so that the correlation, regression coefficient, or other measure of association is near zero. This decoupling is sometimes called discordance,
}
\item{\textbf{“x”}:	one or both features are incorrectly identified, or incorrectly mapped to each other.
}
}

\mbox{}\\
$\delta _{+}$ is defined as ${n_{+ }}/({n_{+ }} + {n_{0}})$, and
$\delta _{0}$ is defined as ${n_{0 }}/({n_{0 }} + {n_{x}})$, where the $n$'s are counts of ID pairs in the three categories.
